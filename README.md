## Overview

AI Travel Guide uses LangChain and FAISS to build a memory-augmented retrieval system that can answer complex travel-related queries based on an embedded travel guide dataset.  
It processes and indexes travel content, connects to an LLM (such as OpenAI’s GPT models), and allows users to query for travel recommendations interactively.

---

## Features

- Personalized travel advice based on user queries.  
- Memory-integrated chat using FAISS vector store for contextual responses.  
- Knowledge base built from the “Colette Worldwide Travel Guide (2021–2023)” dataset.  
- Semantic search powered by embeddings for relevant content retrieval.  
- Human-like, natural answers generated by the LLM.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Travel-Guide.git
cd AI-Travel-Guide
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables  
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your HUGGING_FACE API key:
```
HF_TOKEN =your_hf_token_api_key
```

---

## Usage

### Step 1: Create Vector Memory
```bash
python create_memory_for_llm.py
```
This command processes the travel PDF file and builds a FAISS index.

### Step 2: Connect to the LLM and Query
```bash
python connect_memory_with_llm.py
```
Example query:
> Suggest five must-visit European cities for food lovers.

### Step 3: Run the Interactive Chat
```bash
streamlit run travel_guide.py
```
Engage in a conversation with your AI Travel Assistant to receive contextual travel insights.
